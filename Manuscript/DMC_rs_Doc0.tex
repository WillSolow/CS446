\begin{abstract}
We give an overview of the Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithm and its applications into finding solutions to the Schr\"odinger Equation when no analytical solution is available. An implementation of the DMC algorithm is presented with a specific focus on understanding the behavior of a three-water molecule system. Given the same data structure, a four-dimensional NumPy array, we demonstrate how a fully vectorized implementation is at least 35 times faster than a traditional for loop implementation, and how to validate an inherently less obvious implementation. In such molecularly complicated systems, we show how the role of timestep factors into both the population of walkers and the calculated Zero-Point energy of the system. Following up, we give necessary criteria to find the Zero-Point energy to the desired precision, and show the wave function, a normal distribution of bond lengths or angles within the studied molecular system. Finally, we show the difficulty of equilibrating a complicated system like the water trimer, and we illustrate techniques for how build an equilibrated system when the DMC algorithm is not sufficient on its own when the system is initialized with random values.

\section{Introduction}
The Schr\"odinger equation can be solved for only the simplest of systems. Often, in Chemistry, we wish to know the result of the Schr\"odinger equation for more complicated molecular systems, such as a single water molecule and a water trimer system. However, due to the complexities of these systems, the Schr\"odinger equation is not able to be solved analytically, and so no resulting wave function can be obtained. 

Instead, we turn to the Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithm, first introduced by Anderson. We give an efficient, generalizable, and validated NumPy implementation of the DMC algorithm in order to calculate the Zero-Point energy and wave function of a single water molecule system and water trimer system. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the water trimer system has been studied using DMC methods. 

We give evidence to support the importance of time step when performing calculations, both in the capacity of the Zero-Point energy and the wave function. We show how time step impacts the population of walkers in the DMC algorithm, an interesting discovery, and how a smaller timestep alleviates this problem. 

We conclude with the importance of computational efficiency and give an empirical analysis of two different implementations of the DMC algorithm with specific focus on how the potential energy function is calculated. In any computationally heavy experiment, efficiency is important. We show a strategy for leveraging vectorization techniques to arrive at a meaningfully faster implementation. In addition, we give tools to validate these vectorization techniques given that the code is less inherently obvious than a more typical for loop implementation. 

\section{Related Work}

This semester, we code a python based implementation of the Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm originally presented in Anderson 1975~\cite{Anderson1975}. Our implementation of the DMC algorithm can be directly attributed to Anderson's work, as he was one of the first to propose such a method. At the time, other methods were seen as more computationally efficient for a given level of accuracy. We take Anderson's algorithm and refine it in the scope of being efficient for computing the ground level energy and bond strength of Clathrate Hydrates. 

While Anderson was initially only concerned with the calculation of the ground energy of H3, his simplifying approach to the 1D and 6D systems greatly influenced our approach in initial versions of our implementation. We improve on his work by designing a more efficient, vector-based implementation using the numpy library provided by python. We hope to extend this approach to the task of modelling more complicated Clathrate Hydrates which require an increased computational load.
As Anderson points out, the Schr\"odinger Equation is only analytically solvable for certain, small systems. His DMC algorithm provides such a way to approximate solutions to complex systems. The best solution to modelling Clathrate Hydrates, given the lack of an analytical solution, is an open question. We hope to build on Anderson's work to provide a computationally efficient method for the solution of this problem.


\section{Modeling}
\subsection{The Model}
At a high level, in each loop of the simulation, the DMC algorithm first calculates the reference energy of the system (one can think of this as the average zero-point energy). Then, the algorithm takes an array of walkers, each representing a possible state of the system, and propagates the atoms in each walker within a normal distribution based on the time step. After propagation, the potential energy of each walker is calculated. Walkers with potential energy higher than the reference energy are deleted, based on a given probability, while walkers with reasonable potential energy are replicated. Over many time steps, the reference energy starts to converge to an experimentally found value, and by taking a 1000 step rolling average, one can compute the Zero-Point energy of the system. 

Given the pseudo-randomness leveraged in code-based implementations of the DMC algorithm, this serves to approximate every possible configuration of the system, within the bounds in which it would normally exist in nature. The resulting positions of the atoms in the system serves as the solution to Schr\"odinger’s wave function equation, and we see that the bond lengths and bond angles between atoms appear within a normal distribution of their equilibrium values. 

Over time, the rolling average of the potential energy of all systems that are valid converges to the zero-point energy, or the ground state energy of the system. This produces an approximate solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, which is what the DMC algorithm is modelling.

\subsection{Implementation}
In our implementation of DMC, we write a script-based implementation in Python, relying heavily on the NumPy library, which provides ``vectorization'' for fast operations on large matrices---that is, it allows processors to perform concurrent operations while looping over matrices, greatly reducing runtime compared to conventional looping. The most important variable in the code is a 4D array which stores the Cartesian coordinates of each atom in each molecule in each walker. As we move through the simulation loop of the algorithm, we operate on the walker array to delete and replicate walkers as required by the algorithm.

Notably, the function that calculates potential energy is drastically different from molecular system to molecular system, so the main simulation loop uses calls to the potential energy function for the purpose of extensibility. From system to system, the only other varying part of our code is how we propagate each walker. The distribution of possible propagations for various atoms depends upon their mass, and so subroutine to propogate a particular walker is contingent upon the particular order of atoms therein. This could potentially change with each system, although we hope to find a data structure that allows our code to remain efficient without needing to change how the walkers are propagated at each step. We find some promise in generating the array of propogations---i.e. how far each atom moves in each coordinate---wholesale by stacking together many copies of a list of the walker's atomic masses up to the dimensionality of our 4D array. Otherwise, the entire model is controlled by the initial variables of the simulation.

Through the simulation loop, we rely heavily on the broadcasting features of NumPy to different array dimensions to figure out which walkers are to be deleted or replicated. We like to think that this is done quite cleanly, and do it in a mere 11 lines of code after the walkers are propagated. This efficiency is appealing and has been why we are hesitant to walk away from the 4D array based implementation that we provide. The main disadvantage of this method becomes apparent when considering how to model complicated molecular structures like Clathrate Hydrates, which don't have a consistent number of atoms per molecule as they exhibit heterogeneity of molecules within a walker. This means that one of the four dimensions of our array is ``ragged.'' There are a few ways to work this raggedness into our data structure, but they are all patches rather than ideal solutions.
\subsection{Code Validation}

In any implementation of an algorithm, rigorous testing is required to ensure that the code is producing accurate results. Ideally, data generated from a simulation would be corroborated with data collected experimentally. However, due to the nature of the study of particles, outside of the simplest systems, it is difficult to accurately calculate the ground state energy. As such, results generated from the DMC algorithm cannot be verified against real world data. 

Instead, we turn to manual validation of the code. An outline of the process is as follows: a set of walkers is generated. The validator calculates the potential energy and the reference energy. Using a randomly generated set of thresholds, the validator determines which walkers should be deleted and replicated, and then compares the final array to the final array produced by the algorithm. To be sure of correctness, this process was repeated multiple times with sets of ten walkers over five time steps. These groups of calculations should be comprehensive enough to validate the correctness of the algorithm due to the stochastic nature of the simulation, and generalize well to larger groups of walkers. 

As a final measure, the implementaion of the DMC algorithm was tested to model the carbon monoxide bond, given that the Zero-Point energy of the CO bond is well known. When tested over multiple simulations, the 1,000 step rolling average varied on the order of  $1\cdot10^{-4}$, with a variance on the order of $1\cdot10^{-3}$. Based on prior DMC implementations, this amount of inaccuracy is normal.  

\section{Simulations}
We start with an empirical analysis of a fully vectorized potential energy function and compare it to a for loop implementation. These simulations were done on the single water molecule system and so only the intramolecular potential energy function is considered. With a time step that yields a convergent walker population, in this case we considered dt=.1, we run simulations on systems with different initial walker populations and simulation length to understand how the runtime of the simulation varies under these parameters. With this information we demonstrate the importance of a vectorized approach. While sufficient data is shown below, we see that across all simulations, the improvement is roughly constant.

However, given that this improvment is upward of 30 times faster than a for loop implementation, we see that it is useful to use. Large DMC simulations can take a few hours to run, especially as we consider more complicated systems with more molecules. Thus, this magnitude of improvement becomes drastically more meaningful as run time escalates. (graphs to come)

Now, we show how the time step chosen impacts the convergence of the walker population and the calculated zero point energy. We ran simulations over a variety of time steps and walker populations. To eliminate some of the "noise" in these simulations, given that the DMC algorithm is stochastic in nature, we take the average over 10 or 20 simulations. By doing this, we demonstrate necessary conditions to calculate a zero-point energy that is accurate on the order of five decimal places. We also present the resulting wave function which is represented by the normal distribution of the Oxygen-Hydrogen bond lengths about equilibrium. (graphs coming)

Finally, we perform the same simulation for the water trimer system. The water trimer system is significantly more complicated than a single water molecule system given that we enforce distances between all nine atoms in the system. As such, the conditions for convergence, and finding a reasonable value, are much stricter. Our resulting wave function is a graph of the bond angles between all oxygen atoms in the system. In a water trimer, we would expect to see an equilibrium bond angle of 60 degrees, given that the oxygen angles align themselves in an equiangular triangle. 

\section{Discussion}
When creating a piece of code in the field of Computational Science, its worth is often based on how extendable it is to other projects of interest. In the case of our work, we provide a fast, script-based implementation of the DMC algorithm by leveraging the vectorization provided in the NumPy library. Currently, our work relies on the assumption that the molecules in the modeled system are homogeneous. Clearly, this is not a particularly extendable piece of code, as there are many other interesting systems made up of hetereogeneous molecules. 

This begs us to consider how to create generalizable code that can be used in a variety of circumstances without sacrificing efficiency. Observe that NumPy works well when dealing with arrays of many dimensions. As soon as we change the sizes of the molecules in a walker, the dimensions of our array are no longer even, and so NumPy cannot cleanly vectorize the solution in the 4D data structure that we have presented up to this point. From a programming point of view, it would not be particularly difficult to represent each walker on a singular array dimension. However, this also reduces the extendablility of our code as it makes the potential energy function extraordinarily difficult to calculate, given that each molecule and atom corresponds to a particular index on the same array dimesion. It also makes initializing the walker array cumbersome and unintuitive, as the user would have to memorize a potentially very long string of atoms and know their indices to facilitate the potential energy calculations both within and between molecules in a particular walker. 

We further plan to extend our implementation to include importance sampling which appears in ( ). This will allow us to weight different values of the reference energy. As such, we hope that this allows us to find more accurate data using less computationally expensive methods such as a smaller time step and larger population of walkers.

%
%\subsection{Outline}
%
%The document layout should follow the style of the journal concerned.
%Where appropriate, sections and subsections should be added in the
%normal way. If the class options are set correctly, warnings will be
%given if these should not be present.
%
%\subsection{References}
%
%The class makes various changes to the way that references are
%handled.  The class loads \textsf{natbib}, and also the
%appropriate bibliography style.  References can be made using
%the normal method; the citation should be placed before any
%punctuation, as the class will move it if using a superscript
%citation style
%\cite{Mena2000,Abernethy2003,Friedman-Hill2003,EuropeanCommission2008}.
%The use of \textsf{natbib} allows the use of the various citation
%commands of that package: \citeauthor{Abernethy2003} have shown
%something, in \citeyear{Cotton1999}, or as given by
%Ref.~\citenum{Mena2000}.  Long lists of authors will be
%automatically truncated in most article formats, but not in
%supplementary information or reviews \cite{Pople2003}. If you
%encounter problems with the citation macros, please check that
%your copy of \textsf{natbib} is up to date. The demonstration
%database file \texttt{achemso-demo.bib} shows how to complete
%entries correctly. Notice that ``\latin{et al.}'' is auto-formatted
%using the \texttt{\textbackslash latin} command.
%
%Multiple citations to be combined into a list can be given as
%a single citation.  This uses the \textsf{mciteplus} package
%\cite{Johnson1972,*Arduengo1992,*Eisenstein2005,*Arduengo1994}.
%Citations other than the first of the list should be indicated
%with a star. If the \textsf{mciteplus} package is not installed,
%the standard bibliography tools will still work but starred
%references will be ignored. Individual references can be referred
%to using \texttt{\textbackslash mciteSubRef}:
%``ref.~\mciteSubRef{Eisenstein2005}''.
%
%The class also handles notes to be added to the bibliography.  These
%should be given in place in the document \bibnote{This is a note.
%The text will be moved the the references section.  The title of the
%section will change to ``Notes and References''.}.  As with
%citations, the text should be placed before punctuation.  A note is
%also generated if a citation has an optional note.  This assumes that
%the whole work has already been cited: odd numbering will result if
%this is not the case \cite[p.~1]{Cotton1999}.
%
%\subsection{Floats}
%
%New float types are automatically set up by the class file.  The
%means graphics are included as follows (Scheme~\ref{sch:example}).  As
%illustrated, the float is ``here'' if possible.
%\begin{scheme}
%  Your scheme graphic would go here: \texttt{.eps} format\\
%  for \LaTeX\, or \texttt{.pdf} (or \texttt{.png}) for pdf\LaTeX\\
%  \textsc{ChemDraw} files are best saved as \texttt{.eps} files:\\
%  these can be scaled without loss of quality, and can be\\
%  converted to \texttt{.pdf} files easily using \texttt{eps2pdf}.\\
%  %\includegraphics{graphic}
%  \caption{An example scheme}
%  \label{sch:example}
%\end{scheme}
%
%\begin{figure}
%  As well as the standard float types \texttt{table}\\
%  and \texttt{figure}, the class also recognises\\
%  \texttt{scheme}, \texttt{chart} and \texttt{graph}.
%  \caption{An example figure}
%  \label{fgr:example}
%\end{figure}
%
%Charts, figures and schemes do not necessarily have to be labelled or
%captioned.  However, tables should always have a title. It is
%possible to include a number and label for a graphic without any
%title, using an empty argument to the \texttt{\textbackslash caption}
%macro.
%
%The use of the different floating environments is not required, but
%it is intended to make document preparation easier for authors. In
%general, you should place your graphics where they make logical
%sense; the production process will move them if needed.
%
%\subsection{Math(s)}
%
%The \textsf{achemso} class does not load any particular additional
%support for mathematics.  If packages such as \textsf{amsmath} are
%required, they should be loaded in the preamble.  However,
%the basic \LaTeX\ math(s) input should work correctly without
%this.  Some inline material \( y = mx + c \) or $ 1 + 1 = 2 $
%followed by some display. \[ A = \pi r^2 \]
%
%It is possible to label equations in the usual way (Eq.~\ref{eqn:example}).
%\begin{equation}
%  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \, r^2 = 2r \label{eqn:example}
%\end{equation}
%This can also be used to have equations containing graphical
%content. To align the equation number with the middle of the graphic,
%rather than the bottom, a minipage may be used.
%\begin{equation}
%  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.80\linewidth}
%    \centering
%    As illustrated here, the width of \\
%    the minipage needs to allow some  \\
%    space for the number to fit in to.
%    %\includegraphics{graphic}
%  \end{minipage}
%  \label{eqn:graphic}
%\end{equation}
%
%\section{Experimental}
%
%The usual experimental details should appear here.  This could
%include a table, which can be referenced as Table~\ref{tbl:example}.
%Notice that the caption is positioned at the top of the table.
%\begin{table}
%  \caption{An example table}
%  \label{tbl:example}
%  \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    \hline
%    Header one  & Header two  \\
%    \hline
%    Entry one   & Entry two   \\
%    Entry three & Entry four  \\
%    Entry five  & Entry five  \\
%    Entry seven & Entry eight \\
%    \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%\end{table}
%
%Adding notes to tables can be complicated.  Perhaps the easiest
%method is to generate these using the basic
%\texttt{\textbackslash textsuperscript} and
%\texttt{\textbackslash emph} macros, as illustrated (Table~\ref{tbl:notes}).
%\begin{table}
%  \caption{A table with notes}
%  \label{tbl:notes}
%  \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    \hline
%    Header one                            & Header two \\
%    \hline
%    Entry one\textsuperscript{\emph{a}}   & Entry two  \\
%    Entry three\textsuperscript{\emph{b}} & Entry four \\
%    \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%
%  \textsuperscript{\emph{a}} Some text;
%  \textsuperscript{\emph{b}} Some more text.
%\end{table}
%
%The example file also loads the optional \textsf{mhchem} package, so
%that formulas are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash ch\{H2SO4\}}
%gives \ch{H2SO4}.  See the use in the bibliography file (when using
%titles in the references section).
%
%The use of new commands should be limited to simple things which will
%not interfere with the production process.  For example,
%\texttt{\textbackslash mycommand} has been defined in this example,
%to give italic, mono-spaced text: \mycommand{some text}.
%
%\section{Extra information when writing JACS Communications}
%
%When producing communications for \emph{J.~Am.\ Chem.\ Soc.}, the
%class will automatically lay the text out in the style of the
%journal. This gives a guide to the length of text that can be
%accommodated in such a publication. There are some points to bear in
%mind when preparing a JACS Communication in this way.  The layout
%produced here is a \emph{model} for the published result, and the
%outcome should be taken as a \emph{guide} to the final length. The
%spacing and sizing of graphical content is an area where there is
%some flexibility in the process.  You should not worry about the
%space before and after graphics, which is set to give a guide to the
%published size. This is very dependant on the final published layout.
%
%You should be able to use the same source to produce a JACS
%Communication and a normal article.  For example, this demonstration
%file will work with both \texttt{type=article} and
%\texttt{type=communication}. Sections and any abstract are
%automatically ignored, although you will get warnings to this effect.
